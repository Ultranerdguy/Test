# Packages

These aren't externally obtained packages, but instead just groups of experimental functionality that I was interested in making, that don't really fit in the command system of the main project, but are useful nonetheless.

| Package | Description |
| - | - |
| [terminal](terminal/README.md) | A simple terminal control library |
| [util](util/README.md) | Miscellaneous functionality |
